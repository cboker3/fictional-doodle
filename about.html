          <h2>Hey, I'm Cody.</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Cody Boker, I am an Applications Associate at Continental. I received my degree from
            Rend Lake College in Computer Programming and continuing my education at Western Governors
            University (WGU) in Software Engineering. I am primarily a .NET developer focusing on creating
            enterprise applications to integrate into already existing processes to streamline them. I focus
            on testing and UX to ensure my applications can be easily utilized by the customers we serve. I
            am attempting to progress my DevOps skills through hosting a home lab and various services to
            expand my horizon into adjacent fields.
